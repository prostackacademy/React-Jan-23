Q) When ever calling user Component? I want to dispatch
action?

let User = ()=>{

returnn <></>

}
export default User;

Ans: useEffect() Hoook

What is action?
action is function, it return actional objects.

Redux - thunk
action is function it return function, again calling and return actionable objects

2)How to consume api in redux?


using Axios @ action file only

action is function. reducer is pure function.
